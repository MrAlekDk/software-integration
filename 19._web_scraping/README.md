This is a webscraper made for my System integration course, using the BeautifulSoup4 Python module: https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

It scrapes the danish website "jobindex" for job postings with the search query "Software development" and saves them in a list to be printed.



## How to run
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `poetry install` to install dependencies
3. Run `poetry run python webscraper.py` to run the program
